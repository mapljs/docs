Macro is a mechanism to inject code into Mapl middleware phase.
```ts
app.inline((result, state) => {
  // Inject code
});
```

You can see the type definition in [middleware.ts](https://github.com/mapljs/app/blob/main/src/router/types/middleware.ts#L8)
and an example of a request body parser in [parseBody.ts](https://github.com/mapljs/app/blob/main/tests/apps/basic/macros/parseBody.ts).
