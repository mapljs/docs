description: Details about the Mapl compiler

To provide these abstractions without sacrifising performance, Mapl uses a compiler
to optimize the fetch handler before request time.

## JIT compilation
Mapl exposes `jitc()` to compile an instance to a fetch handler with `new Function()`:
```ts
import { jitc } from '@mapl/app';

const result = await jitc(app);

result.fetch; // The fetch function
```

## AOT compilation
You can precompile the fetch handler content with `aotfn()`:
```ts
import { aotfn } from '@mapl/app';

writeFileSync('fetch.mjs', `export default ${aotfn(app)};`);
```

Then load with necessary dependencies to create a fetch function:
```ts
import createFetch from './fetch.mjs';
import { aotdeps } from '@mapl/app';

const result = await createFetch(aotdeps(app));
```

This approach often results in 5x faster startup time than JIT compilation.

Since AOT compilation does not use `new Function()`, this unblocks Mapl on edge runtimes where `eval()` and `new Function()` are not allowed (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, ...).

## Compiler options
You can pass an option object to `aotfn` and `jitc`.

### `exposeStatic`
If set to true, prebuilt routes will be exposed as the `static`
property in the final compilation result instead of registered to the router.

Example usage with Bun:
```ts
import { router, jitc } from '@mapl/app';

// Build a static route
const app = router().build('/', () => 'Hi');

// Serve directly as Bun handles `fetch` and
// `static` property automatically
export default await jitc(app, {
  exposeStatic: true
});
```
