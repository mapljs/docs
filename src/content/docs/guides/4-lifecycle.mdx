Mapl request lifecycle can be illustrated as follows:

![Lifecycle](/diagrams/lifecycle.svg)

## Middlewares
Middlewares are functions that get executed on every request, after the route matching phase.
```ts
app.apply((c) => {
  c.headers.push(['Server', 'Mapl']);
});
```

The above snippet adds the `Server` header to every response if the request path matched any of the defined patterns.

Note that middlewares share the same limitation as handlers, as if a middleware function returns a
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object it must be marked as an `async` function.

### Setters
Setter is a type of middleware that its returned value will be attached to the [Context](/api/context) object.
```ts
// 'c.date' is now the current date
app.set('date', () => new Date());
```

The value can be used in any handler or middleware after it:
```ts
// Chaining should be used so you get type hint
app
  .set('date', () => new Date())
  .get('/time', (c) => `Current time: ${c.date.toUTCString()}`);
```

### Errors
Mapl uses a much lighter and faster error implementation based on [`safe-throw`](https://npmjs.com/package/safe-throw).

To handle exceptions, use `app.err`:
```ts
import * as st from 'safe-throw';

// Error type is inferred based on previous middlewares
app.err((error, c) => {
  c.status = 400;
  return st.payload(error);
});
```

Exceptions are meant to be used with validators and parsers to handle edge cases.

### Validators
Validator is a type of middleware to validate requests.
```ts
import * as st from 'safe-throw';

const bodyTooShort = st.err('Body too short');

app.check(async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.text();

  if (body.length < 9)
    return bodyTooShort;
});
```

If an exception is returned, the correct exception handler will be called.

If no exception handler is registered for that error (including the handler for all exceptions),
a `400 Bad Request` response will be returned.

### Parsers
Parsers can return exceptions like validators, but if the return value is anything other than an exception it gets attached to the context.
```ts
const invalidAuthHeader = st.err('Invalid Authorization header');

// Chaining should be used so you get type hint
app
  .parse('token', (c) => {
    const authHeader = c.req.headers.get('authorization');

    // Get the bearer token
    return authHeader === null || !authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')
      ? invalidAuthHeader
      // Return the value to be attached to the context
      : authHeader.slice(7);
  })
  .get('/', (c) => `Your token: ${c.token}`)

  // Handle returned errors
  .err((error, c) => {
    c.status = 403;

    // Return the text of the error
    return st.payload(error);
  });
```
