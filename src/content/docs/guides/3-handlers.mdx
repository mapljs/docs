title: Handlers
description: Intro to route handlers

A handler is a function that recieves a [Context](/api/context) object and return a response.

As in previous examples, handlers can return [anything](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#body)
that is supported by the [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) constructor.
```ts
app.get('/', () => 'Hi');
```

The handler can access the [Context](/api/context) object, which contains the original request object and response options.
```ts
app.get('/', (c) => {
  c.status = 201; // Set status code. Default value is 200
  c.statusText = 'Hi'; // Set status text
  c.headers.push(['Server', 'Mapl']); // Add a header pair
  console.log(c.req.headers); // Log request headers
  return 'Hi';
});

// Context always comes after the special argument of the function
app.get('/:user/name', (user, c) => {
  c.headers.push(['Server', 'Mapl']);
  return user;
});
```

Note that response headers are stored as key-value pairs in an array.

<summary>Why store headers in an array instead of an object?</summary>

To have multiple header values, the headers need to be appended later to the
[Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object of the final [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response),
which is much slower than arrays and objects as [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) has to do additional
operations to normalize the header key and value **on insertion**.

Furthermore, JS engines often create internal structures for optimizing property accesses, which leads to more memory being used compared to arrays.

  <summary>Why does context always comes after the special argument of the handler function?</summary>

  These special arguments are likely to be used than the [Context](/api/context) object so putting them as the first argument allows for an optimization
  when only that special argument is used.

  I was thinking about attaching them to the [Context](/api/context) object but that will make it slower, uses more memory and disallow the optimization
  mentioned above as you have to create a full context with that special argument value attached to it.

Mapl also includes handlers to send different types of data.

- To return HTML directly without appending headers:
    ```ts
    app.get('/page/*', (link) => `<p>${link}</p>`, { type: 'html' });
    ```

    This is faster than writing it using normal handlers (try benchmarking it yourself :]).

- To return JSON directly without appending headers:
    ```ts
    app.get(
      '/info/*',
      (info) => ({
        name: info,
        id: Math.random()
      }),
      { type: 'json' }
    );
    ```

    This is also faster than writing it using normal handlers, as it uses the same optimization as HTML handlers.

If the handler function returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object,
it must be marked as an `async` function for the compiler to detect and generate correct code.
