title: Handlers
description: Intro to route handlers

A handler is a function that recieves a [Context](/api/context) object and return a response.

As in previous examples, handlers can return [anything](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#body)
that is supported by the [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) constructor.
```ts
app.get('/', () => 'Hi');
```

The handler can access the [Context](/api/context) object, which contains the original request object and response options.
```ts
app.get('/', (c) => {
  c.status = 201; // Set status code. Default value is 200
  c.statusText = 'Hi'; // Set status text
  c.headers.push(['Server', 'Mapl']); // Add a header pair
  return 'Hi';
});

// Context always comes after the special argument of the function
app.get('/*/name', (params, c) => {
  c.headers.push(['Server', 'Mapl']);
  return params[0];
});
```

Note that response headers are stored as key-value pairs in an array.

<summary>Why store headers in an array instead of an object?</summary>

To have multiple header values, the headers need to be appended later to the
[Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object of the final [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response),
which is much slower than arrays and objects as [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) has to do additional
operations to normalize the header key and value **on insertion**.

Furthermore, JS engines often create internal structures for optimizing property accesses, which leads to more memory being used compared to arrays.

<details>
  <summary>Why does context always comes after the special argument of the handler function?</summary>

  These special arguments are likely to be used than the [Context](/api/context) object so putting them as the first argument allows for an optimization
  when only that special argument is used.

  I was thinking about attaching them to the [Context](/api/context) object but that will make it slower, uses more memory and disallow the optimization
  mentioned above as you have to create a full context with that special argument value attached to it.

Mapl also includes handlers to send different types of data.

- To return HTML directly without appending headers:
    ```ts
    app.get('/page/*', {
      type: 'html',
      fn: (params) => `<p>${params[0]}</p>`
    });
    ```

    This is in fact faster than writing it using normal handlers (try to see it yourself :]).

- To return JSON directly without appending headers:
    ```ts
    app.get('/info/*', {
      type: 'json',
      fn: (params) => ({
        name: params[0],
        id: Math.random()
      })
    });
    ```

    This is also faster than writing it using normal handlers, as it uses the same optimization as HTML handlers.

- To return static content:
    ```ts
    app.get('/', {
      type: 'static',
      body: 'Hi',
      options: { status: 200 }
    });
    ```

    The `body` and `options` get cached under the hood to reduce unnecessary operations on every request.

If the handler function returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) object,
it must be marked as an `async` function for the compiler to detect and generate correct code.

### Prebuilts
This feature runs the handler with a sample `GET` request to the corresponding path, the
result [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) is cached and served later in request time.
```ts
app.build('/', () => 'Hi');
```

You can do any expensive operations inside the handler without affecting request performance.
```ts
app.build('/', (c) => {
  const result = runExpensiveOperation(c.req);
  return `Your result: ${result}`;
});
```

This is designed to mimic [Bun static routes](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#static-routes) behavior,
which means `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` methods are also handled automatically.

You can also make it runs faster in Bun by handing the routes to Bun directly:
```ts
const result = await jitc(app, {
  exposeStatic: true
});
result.static;
```
