import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can install Mapl from [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@mapl/app).
```sh
npm i @mapl/app
```

Create a new file and add the following code:
```ts title="server.ts"
import { jitc, router } from '@mapl/app';

// Create a router
const app = router()
  // Add a route that matches GET requests to '/'
  .get('/', () => 'Hi');

// Build the fetch function
const fetch = jitc(app);

// Export the function to be executed
export default { fetch };
```

Then run the file with [Bun](//bun.sh) or [Deno](//deno.land).
```sh
# Bun
bun server.ts

# Deno
deno serve server.ts --port 3000
```

And done! We just build a simple web server running on [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

### Explanation

<Steps>

1. First we create a router instance by calling `router()`.
    ```ts
    const app = router();
    ```

2. Then we add an endpoint that returns `Hi` as a response.
    ```ts
    const app = router()
      .get('/', () => 'Hi');
    ```

    You can return [anything](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#body)
    that is supported by the [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) constructor,
    which includes `string`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`, `ReadableStream`, ...

    Chaining is also possible since every method returns the current app instance.
    ```ts
    const app = router()
      .get('/', () => 'Hi')
      .get('/hello', () => 'Hello');
    ```

3. Then we use the compiler to generate a function that takes in
    a [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object and returns a
    [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) object.
    ```ts
    const fetch = jitc(app);
    ```

4. Finally we export the function correctly for the runtime to execute.
